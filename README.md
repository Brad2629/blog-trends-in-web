# blog-trends-in-web

## Description

Our final project web app will be a simplified version of a forum similar to Reddit where users can create their own posts, delete them, and interact with each other's posts. The user must be logged in using Google to be able to create, delete, or like a post. Users will be presented with a homepage with all the posts currently in the database. They can interact with all the posts by clicking the heart icon on the specific post. When users hover over their own post, they are able to click the trash icon that appears to delete their own post. The user can create a new post using the Add button in the navigation bar, leading them to a create post page that includes a title, description, and a create post button.
