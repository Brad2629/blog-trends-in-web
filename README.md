# blog-trends-in-web

Description:

Our final project web app will be a forum similar to Reddit where users can create posts and comment on each other’s posts. Users will be presented to a homepage with all posts in the database. They can view all posts on the homepage and interact with a post by liking it or clicking on it. When a user clicks on a post, the post’s individual page where they can add a comment on the post and like the post. The user has to login in order to comment on the post or interact with the post. On the homepage, the user can create a new post, leading them to a create post web page that includes title, text, and a create post button.
